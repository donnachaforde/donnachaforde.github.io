Welcome to my homepage on GitHub

I'm still getting to grips with GitHub Pages and working out how best to organize this. I'm trying to pull bits n' pieces across several repos together here into one organized site.

*** 

## Code & Scripts
Here are public repos that are in a presentable form.

[GitHub](https://github.com/donnachaforde)

Slides from a few talks I've delivered are available [here](talks/README.md)

## Posts & Blogs

Some years back, I wrote a blog on JVM Performance Tuning

* [JVM Performance Tuning](blogs/jvm-performance-tuning/README.md) 

The entire series of blogs is published on Blogger.com, starting [here](https://donnachaforde.blogspot.com/2015/09/jvm-performance-tuning-part-i-jvm.html).


Some ruminations on code-level design issues that I've started to capture are here:

*  [Code Design](blogs/code-design/README.md)



I'm now publishing posts directly on GitHub Pages.

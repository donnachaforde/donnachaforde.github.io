Welcome to my homepage on GitHub

I'm still getting to grips with GitHub Pages and working out how best to organize this. I'm trying to pull bits n' pieces across several repos together here into one organized site.

*** 

## Code 
Here are public repos on GitHub that are in a presentable form.

* [GitHub](https://github.com/donnachaforde)

	These include code examples (mostly C/C++/Java) but also some basic shell-scrips.

## Posts & Blogs



* [JVM Performance Tuning](blogs/jvm-performance-tuning/README.md) 

	Some years back, I wrote a blog on JVM Performance Tuning. The entire series of blogs is published on Blogger.com, starting [here](https://donnachaforde.blogspot.com/2015/09/jvm-performance-tuning-part-i-jvm.html).




*  [Code Design](blogs/code-design/README.md)
	
	Ruminations on code-level design issues that I've started to capture.



* [Posts](posts/README.md)

	I'm now publishing posts directly on GitHub Pages.

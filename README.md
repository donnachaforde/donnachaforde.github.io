Welcome to my **GitHub Pages** where you'll find everything I've made available online. There are Posts & Blogs I've written on all things related to Software Engineering as well links to code samples and 'hobby horse' projects. You'll also find an outline of the University course I've delivered on _Software Architecture & Design_ at [MTU](www.mtu.ie). 



## [Posts & Blogs](https://donnachaforde.github.io/blogs+posts)

* [Software Engineering](./blogs%2Bposts/software-engineering) - Blogs on a wide range of software engineering and architecture topics. 

* [Designing the 'espresso library'](./blogs%2Bposts/code-design) - Ruminations on Object-Oriented design.

* [JVM Performance Tuning](./blogs%2Bposts/jvm-performance-tuning) - A series of blogs I wrote summarizing my experiences tuning the JVM. 



## [Code on GitHub](https://github.com/donnachaforde?tab=repositories&q=&type=public&language=&sort=) 
Here are public repos on GitHub that are in a presentable form.

* [espresso lib](https://github.com/donnachaforde/espresso) - A hobby-horse project - i.e. an easy-to-use command-line parser for CLI applications. 

* [espresso tools](https://github.com/donnachaforde/espresso-tools) - A collection of useful CLI tools, which leverages the espresso library. 

* [Examples](https://github.com/donnachaforde?tab=repositories&q=example&type=public&language=&sort=) - Simple code examples covering Sockets, MQTT, AMQP and REST, mostly written in Java/Spring and C/C++.  

* [Hello World!](https://github.com/donnachaforde/example-hello-world) - Various implementations of the famous K&R "Hello World!" in different languages.

* [Bash Shell Profile](https://github.com/donnachaforde/unix-shell-config) - Resource files for configuring your Bash Shell environment on Linux and UNIX. 

* [GitHub Repos](https://github.com/donnachaforde) - All public repos (mostly C/C++/Java but also some helper shell-scripts).




## [Lectures](https://donnachaforde.github.io/lectures/)

 I developed and delivered the anchor module for an [MSc in Software Architecture & Design](https://www.mtu.ie/courses/crksade9/) at [MTU](https://www.mtu.ie/) during 2017-2019 (_formerly CIT - Cork Institute of Technology_).  
 
 A short summary of the lectures are available [here.](./lectures/README.md)

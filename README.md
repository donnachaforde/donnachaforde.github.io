## [Code](https://github.com/donnachaforde?tab=repositories&q=&type=public&language=&sort=) 
Here are public repos on GitHub that are in a presentable form.

* [Espresso](https://github.com/donnachaforde?tab=repositories&q=espresso&type=public&language=&sort=) - My hobby-horse project: an easy to use command-line parser library and some handy CLI tools. 

* [Examples](https://github.com/donnachaforde?tab=repositories&q=example&type=public&language=&sort=) - Simple code examples covering Sockets, MQTT, AMQP and REST, mostly written in Java/Spring and C/C++.  

* [GitHub](https://github.com/donnachaforde) - All public repos (mostly C/C++/Java but also some helper shell-scripts).

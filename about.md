### About

My [about.me](https://about.me/donnacha.forde) page has my social media links and some profile details. 

My professional career history is outlined on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donnachaforde). 

> **Note** -  Regarding LinkedIn connection requests, I like to keep my LinkedIn contacts real in the sense that I actually like to know my connections. Consequently, I don't generally accept blank connection invitations, especially anything resembling a mailshot. I remain open to genuine connection requests though so please do introduce yourself.

# Talks

### Working in the Software Industry (delivered at UCC 2016)
This was a talk given to UCC 3rd year undergraduates in February 2016, before they undertook internships. I talk about the various roles in the industry and the skills needed by software engineers covering both technical and 'soft skills'. I go on to cover industry trends at the time with an emphasis on IoT (the focus of where I worked at the time), how and where we work. I finished the talk with a Q&A and with questions for the audience to consider to help them determine the type of job they might like and the sort of company they would like to work for.

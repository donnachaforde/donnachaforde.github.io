It's September and apart from being time to go back to school, it's also the time many sports clubs get going for the Winter season. If you have young children, say around 5-7 years old, then depending on the sporting body, you may be enrolling them for the first time - and you may be asked to help out for the first time. You may be asked to become a coach. 

It's now over 12 years since I found myself on the sideline and got roped in to help out. It was probably an easy sell because I've always had an inkling to pay-back and so, coaching provided an avenue to do just that. When I was a lad, I played sports and I was involved in scouting and I could have done neither save for the time given by adults as coaches and leaders respectively. I firmly believe being involved in those activities were the building blocks of my character and the lessons I learned me have served me well in life and in my career. It was only later in life that I really appreciated all the time and effort those people had gone to so that we could play our sport or do our scouting activities. 

Besides, I figured I was going to be there anyway – I may as well be running around and staying warm rather than freezing my butt off standing on the sideline. 

My son has now graduated out of youth sports and I’ve ended up travelling on that same journey as a coach over the years at minis and then youths level, right up to U18s. Each level provided learnings as a coach and in many ways, my ability as a coach, mentor and team manager have grown at each level. I’ve learned more about Sports Management and Sports Science than when I started and I’ve been fortunate enough to have received training on the latest approach to Sport Management, covering motivation, communication and performance. As my professional career led me into leadership roles, I’ve come to realise that there’s little-to-no difference between Management and Sports Management so the lessons gained here have made me a better leader in y day-job. Sure, there is some chore-work to be done and that can be time-consuming at times, but the rewards of seeing young people develop and grow is very rewarding. I’m often reminding of advice I received in my first coach training, “they won’t always remember what you said to them, but they’ll always remember how you made them feel”. That advice stuck with me. 

The other nugget of wisdom is a question to yourself – “Why do you want to coach?” It’s a simple question that doesn’t require an outwardly verbal response but does require you taking a good look at yourself. Are you coaching because you want to win, because you want to game success for your child, because you didn’t reach your potential as an athlete and now, you want to maximize the chances for your child? Subconsciously, there are often among the reasons why people have a driving ambition to coach. But, these are all the wrong reasons. Coaching is about giving. It’s about giving and not expecting to receive. It’s not about the wining. It’s about giving, perhaps the way someone gave to you. It’s about giving-back. 



My advice is, if you're asked or if you feel you've got something to give, then put your hand up - you won't regret it. Or rather, there will most certainly be times you will regret it but overall, it'll be worth it.

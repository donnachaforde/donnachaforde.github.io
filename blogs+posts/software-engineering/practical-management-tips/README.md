# The secret of my success… Part I

Between 2016 and 2021, my engineering teams went through one of the most intense — and successful — periods of my career. We delivered projects at breakneck speed, and looking back, that stretch of time at the coalface taught me what really drives engineering performance.

There are many factors behind a successful team, but these practical habits stand out. They don’t require special talent, just discipline — and almost any organization can put them into practice.

1.	**Keep standups short and on point** – Standups are for alignment, not debate. Keep the team focused because while engineers often feel compelled to justify themselves, others don't need the details and just want to get back to work. 

> [!TIP]
> One team I managed struggled to keep the standup short, despite abundant encouragement. In the end, I introduced an egg-timer set to a two-minute interval. The egg-timer was passed around the standup, reset for each team member as the gave their update. If the alarm triggered while you were holding the egg-timer, the forfeit was to buy the team coffee from the expensive espresso bar. Needless to say, it only ever timed out once and standups never, ever went longer than 15 mins. Problem solved!

2.	**Move discussions to follow-up meetings** - If a deeper conversation is needed, book it right after the standup. Let the right people opt in, instead of holding everyone hostage.


3.	**Protect Morning Periods** - For most engineers, mornings are prime productivity time. Avoid booking meetings then, so they can tackle their hardest problems when they’re freshest. This can be a challenge in organizations that operate across multiple time zones, so if you do have to arrange, say, a standup meeting in someone's morning, try to preserve the rest of that block. 

4.	**Give engineers long, contiguous blocks** -  
A fragmented schedule kills an engineer's momentum. As Paul Graham explained in [Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule](https://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html), managers think in half-hour slots, but engineers need hours at a stretch. Back-to-back short meetings are better than ones scattered across the day that splits those contiguous blocks of time. Engineers need those long blocks to get into the zone and make tackle complex problems.


5.	**Respect Flow** – Studies have shown that it takes around 15-20 minutes to achieve a state of concentration. The length of time you manage to stay in that state is known as ‘flow’. Any interruptions, even trivial ones, reset the clock and prevent that state of deep focus ever being achieved. And, that's where the real work gets done. 

6.	**Resist Breaking the Standup Cycle** - If you’ve asked an engineering to get something done by tomorrow, then let them get on with it. Repeated check-ins and requests for updates only creates disruption. 

7.	**Provide Air Cover** - As a manager, your job is to absorb the noise. Most organizations have more people asking for updates than producing code. Shield your team from constant interruptions by being the single point of contact. Let them focus on building while you handle the information flow. Updates come from through you - and you alone. Don't tolerate others bypassing you and instruct your team to politely direct inquiries to you. 



It might seem rather basic but these simple practices helped my teams increase productivity and deliver at extraordinary speed without burning out. They’re not complicated — they just require consistency and discipline.

In Part II, I’ll share how we built culture, trust, and technical excellence on top of this foundation.

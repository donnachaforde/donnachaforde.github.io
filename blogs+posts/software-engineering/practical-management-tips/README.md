The secret to my success…

The period 2016-2021 was and intense and insanely successful period for my engineering teams. Looking back, that time where I directly led engineering teams at the coal-face was highly concentrated with successful project deliveries in crazy fast timelines. 

While there are a multitude of factors that go into making engineering teams successful, I’d like to share the most important practical tips. These require no specific talent yet directly contribute to team performance and almost every organization could put them into practice.

1.	Keep your standups short and on point. – Yeah, there are lots of things the team will want to cover but there may well be people in the standup that don’t need to be involved and just want to get back to work. 

2.	Book team discussion meetings for immediately after your team standup. – If you do need discussion time, book it as a separate meeting and let people opt in to attend it. 

3.	Do not book meetings with engineers in the morning time. – For most people, though not all, the morning period is the most productive of the day so let them have it to work on their most challenging tasks. 

4.	Ensure your engineers have contiguous blocks of time. If you need to arrange, say, two meetings on different topics and can keep each to 30 mins, then it’s better to book these meetings back to back rather than splitting the engineers’ schedules. There is a very good post on the difference between a manager’s schedule and an engineer's schedule (called the Manager vs Maker) that explains that, as a manager covering a wide range of aspects important to the project, you’ll tend to view your calendar as a series of short half-hour meetings. But, if you apply this model to meetings with your team, then you run the risk of inadvertently splitting the change for them to work in contiguous blocks on hard problems. 

5.	Respect Flow – It takes around 15-20 minutes to achieve a state of concentration. The length of time you manage to stay in that state is known as ‘flow’. Consequently, any interruption, no matter how trivial, every 10-15 mins will mean that you never achieve a state of concentration. And, that concentrated mind is where your engineers need to be to get anything substantial done. 

6.	Respect the sanctity of the standup – if you’ve asked an engineering to get something done by tomorrow, then let them alone to get on with it. You run the risk of interrupting their progress if you’re looking for an update before the next standup. 

7.	Give your team aircover. – Protect your team from the need for incessant updates. As the manager, that’s your job. In most software organizations, there seems to be more people not directly involved in producing code than those that are. That means the organization’s demand for information and updates can overwhelm the team that are  actually responsible for producing the artefacts. Updates come from through you - and you alone. Discourage others from bypassing you and instruct you team to politely direct inquiries to you. Apart from missing out on important conversations, the aim is to preserve those contiguous blocks of time.

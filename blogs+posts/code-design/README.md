# Blogs on Code Design

I'm trying to develop the habit of blogging about design choices as I work through coding, starting with a project I've recently resurrected. 

First, I've learnt that thinking can be improved just through the process of _putting pen to paper_. At one point in my career, while sustaining a highly complex system in the field, I adopted a process of summarising bug reports and found the process to be invaluable at wading through all the crud to get to the facts. Nowadays, I adopt much the same process when designing code solutions. Writing things down helps the thought-process.

Second, when working with languages like C++ and Java, but particularly with C++, there are often so many choices on how to achieve a solution that the mind can become boggled. The act of writing down what you what to achieve, why you want to do it - and listing influences on your thought-process - really helps clarify those choices, It also explains the _design journey_ that the code, representing the end-stage, can't quite ever reveal.

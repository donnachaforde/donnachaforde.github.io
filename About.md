# About

My [about.me](https://about.me/donnacha.forde) page has my social media links and some profile details. 

My professional career history is outlined on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donnachaforde). 



> **Note**
>I like to keep my LinkedIn contacts real in the sense that I actually know the people I connect with. This is mostly the people I've worked with over the years so I don't usually accept blank connection requests, especially if they resemble mailshot. I am of course open to making new connections but please make an effort to show you've actually looked at my profile.
